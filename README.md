  - Java 8 (manual installation from Adoptium)
  - Java 11, 17, 19, default (via apt)
- Prevents duplicate installations
- Set default version for `java` and `javac`
- List all installed Java versions
- Optional logging

## ‚ö° Usage

1. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x install_java.sh
```

2. Start it:
```bash
./install_java.sh           # without logging
./install_java.sh --log     # with logging to install_java.log
```

3. Choose the Java version(s) you want to install (e.g. `1 3 5` for Java 8, 17, latest).

4. The script automatically detects if a version is already installed.

5. At the end, you can set the default version for `java` and `javac`.
